    "#### Step 1: Open Notebook\n",
    "- **Method A**: Click the \"Open in Colab\" link above\n",
    "- **Method B**: \n",
    "  1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "  2. Click **File** → **Open notebook** → **GitHub** tab\n",
    "  3. Enter: `oviya-raja/ist-402-assignments`\n",
    "  4. Navigate to: `IST402/assignments/W3/reference/W3__Prompt_Engineering w_QA Applications-2.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Enable GPU (Recommended)\n",

    "1. Run **Cell 4** → It will automatically create a `.env` file\n",
    "2. Click the **folder icon (📁)** in the left sidebar\n",
    "3. Find and click `.env` file\n",
    "4. Replace `your_token_here` with your actual token\n",

    "\n",
    "**Create `.env` file manually:**\n",
    "1. Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as this notebook\n",
    "2. Add this line: `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here`\n",

    "### 404 Error When Opening from GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible causes:**\n",
    "- Repository doesn't exist yet → Use **Option 2** (Upload to Colab)\n",
    "- Repository is private → Make it public or use **Option 2**\n",
    "- Wrong branch → Try changing `main` to `master` in the link\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Upload the notebook directly to Colab:\n",
    "1. Download this notebook\n",
    "2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",

    "### Token Not Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check that `.env` file exists and has correct format: `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=token` (no spaces)\n",
    "- Make sure you re-ran Cell 4 after creating/editing `.env`\n",
