# Bloom's Taxonomy Framework

This portfolio uses **Bloom's Taxonomy** to demonstrate learning progression from basic recall to creative synthesis.

## The Six Levels

### 1️⃣ Remember (Knowledge)
**What I Recalled:**
- Key definitions and terminology
- Technology stacks and tools
- Core concepts and principles

**Example:** "I recalled that RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and uses vector embeddings for semantic search."

---

### 2️⃣ Understand (Comprehension)
**What I Understood:**
- How systems work (processes and mechanisms)
- Why approaches are effective
- Relationships between concepts

**Example:** "I understand that RAG works by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base, augmenting the user query with this context, and then generating a response using an LLM."

---

### 3️⃣ Apply (Application)
**What I Applied:**
- Using tools and frameworks
- Implementing solutions
- Building working systems

**Example:** "I applied FAISS to build a vector database and implemented a similarity search function to retrieve relevant Q&A pairs."

---

### 4️⃣ Analyze (Analysis)
**What I Analyzed:**
- Comparing different approaches
- Breaking down components
- Examining performance metrics

**Example:** "I analyzed 6 different QA models, comparing their accuracy, response time, and quality on answerable vs unanswerable questions."

---

### 5️⃣ Evaluate (Evaluation)
**What I Evaluated:**
- Judging model performance
- Critiquing implementation choices
- Justifying decisions

**Example:** "I evaluated that Model X performed best because it achieved 85% accuracy while maintaining fast response times, making it suitable for production use."

---

### 6️⃣ Create (Synthesis)
**What I Created:**
- Original implementations
- Complete working systems
- Portfolio-ready deliverables

**Example:** "I created a complete RAG system with custom business context, FAISS vector database, and model comparison framework that can be deployed for production use."

## Why This Framework?

Using Bloom's Taxonomy helps demonstrate:
- **Depth of understanding** - Not just what, but why and how
- **Practical application** - Real implementations, not just theory
- **Critical thinking** - Analysis and evaluation of choices
- **Originality** - Creative synthesis of concepts

## How It's Applied

Each week's documentation follows this structure:
1. **Overview** - Context and objectives
2. **Remember** - Concepts recalled
3. **Understand** - How things work
4. **Apply** - Implementation
5. **Analyze** - Comparisons and breakdowns
6. **Evaluate** - Performance assessment
7. **Create** - Final deliverables

This ensures comprehensive documentation of learning at every level.
