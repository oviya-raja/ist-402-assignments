# 2️⃣ Understand (Comprehension)

## 🚧 Placeholder - Complete Assignment First

**What I Understood:**

After completing the Week 3 assignment, document how you understand the systems and concepts work.

### Key Areas to Document:
- How RAG systems work (Retrieve → Augment → Generate)
- Why vector embeddings enable semantic search
- How FAISS enables fast similarity search
- Why system prompts shape LLM behavior

### Example Format:
```markdown
## How RAG Works

I understand that RAG works in three stages:

1. **Retrieve**: Convert user query to embeddings, search vector database for similar content
2. **Augment**: Combine retrieved context with user query
3. **Generate**: LLM uses augmented context to produce accurate responses

## Why Embeddings Matter

I understand that vector embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing the system to find relevant information even when exact keywords don't match.
