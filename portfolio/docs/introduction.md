## About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my learning journey through IST402, demonstrating understanding through **Bloom's Taxonomy** framework:

1. **Remember** - Key concepts and definitions
2. **Understand** - How systems work
3. **Apply** - Building implementations
4. **Analyze** - Comparing and breaking down components
5. **Evaluate** - Assessing performance and making judgments
6. **Create** - Original implementations and deliverables

## Course Structure

This portfolio documents work from:
- **[Week 3 - Prompt Engineering & QA](./week3-prompt-engineering/overview)**
- **[Week 6 - AI Agents with n8n (Optional)](./week6-ai-agents-n8n/overview)**
- **[Week 7 - Group Assignment](./week7-group-assignment/overview)**
- **[Week 8 - Multimodal AI Applications](./week8-multimodal/overview)**
